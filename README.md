# FireGuard
Implemented a fire detection system in Python using OpenCV, capable of
analyzing video frames, identifying fires through color filtering in the HSV color space, and
triggering alarms. Employed threading for real-time audio alerts and attempted email
notifications for immediate response to potential fire incidents.
